I'm from the USA 🇺🇸, currently in the Eastern Standard Time Zone 🌎. I'm a huge fan of Node.js, TypeScript, open-source, and writing testable software 💻. When I'm not crushing bugs or building dreams, I can be found playing golf 🏌️, playing hockey 🏒, snowboarding 🏂, lifting weights 🏋️, and spending time with my beautiful wife Cassie ❤️.
